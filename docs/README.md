- If you’re unsure about a file’s purpose, refer to its folder name or consult the documentation.

Great! Let’s incorporate the **Onboarding Customization** section into **Step 5: Customizing the App**, and also refine the localization steps to include updating translation keys. I'll structure it clearly so users can easily follow the instructions.


## **5. Customizing the App**

This section explains how to customize your app using the provided script and manual steps for specific customizations.

---

### **5.1 Recommended: Enable the RPS Package Globally**
The **RPS (Run Pub Script)** package allows you to run Dart scripts globally without needing to specify the full path. To enable it:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to activate the RPS package globally:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate rps
   ```
2. After activation, you can run any Dart script in the project using the `rps` command.

   Example:
   ```bash
   rps customize
   ```

> **Note**: Using the RPS package is highly recommended as it simplifies script execution and avoids path-related issues.

> **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter permission issues while activating the RPS package, ensure your system allows global installations or use `sudo` (on macOS/Linux) or run the terminal as an administrator (on Windows).

---

### **5.2 Using the Customization Script**

The app includes a powerful customization script (`lib/dev_tool/.customize.dart`) that allows you to easily update key aspects of the app, such as the app name, package name, base URL, and app icon. Follow these steps to use the script:

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your `customization.yaml` File**
- Locate the `customization.yaml` file in the root directory of the project (e.g., `customization.yaml`).
- Open the file and update the following fields:
  ```yaml
  app_name: "YourAppName"
  package_name: "com.yourcompany.yourappname"
  org_domain: "yourdomain.com"
  base_url: "https://yourdomain.com"
  ```
  - **`app_name`**: The name of your app.
  - **`package_name`**: The unique identifier for your app (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourappname`).
  - **`org_domain`**: The domain name for your organization. [This will be displayed in places for branding. (e.g., Footer of PDF, Thermal Invoices etc)]
  - **`base_url`**: The backend domain URL for API requests.

#### **Step 2: Run the Script**
- Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.
- Use the following command to run the script:
  ```bash
  rps customize
  ```
  This will apply all customizations (app name, package name, base URL, and app icon).

#### **Step 3: Customize Specific Features (Optional Flags)**
If you want to customize only specific features, use the following flags:
- **Change Base URL Only**:
  ```bash
  rps customize --baseUrl-only
  ```
- **Change Organization Domain Only**:
  ```bash
  rps customize --orgDomain-only
  ```
- **Change Package Name Only**:
  ```bash
  rps customize --packageName-only
  ```
- **Change App Name Only**:
  ```bash
  rps customize --appName-only
  ```
- **Change App Icon Only**:
  ```bash
  rps customize --icon-only
  ```

#### **Step 4: Verify Changes**
- After running the script, verify the changes:
  - Restart the app to see the updated app name, package name, and base URL.
  - Ensure the app icon has been updated by checking the launcher.

  Here's a quick overview for the `customize` script:
  ```markdown
  | Flag                 | Description                               |
  | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | `--baseUrl-only`     | Changes only the base URL.                |
  | `--orgDomain-only`   | Changes only the organization domain.     |
  | `--packageName-only` | Changes only the package name.            |
  | `--appName-only`     | Changes only the app name.                |
  | `--icon-only`        | Changes only the app icon.                |
  ```
---

### **5.3 Manual Customizations**

For additional customizations not covered by the script, follow the steps below:

#### **5.3.1 Changing Onboarding Screen Content**
Customizing the onboarding screens involves updating both images and text content. Follow these steps:

##### **Step 1: Replace Onboarding Images**
- Navigate to the `/assets/images/onboard` folder.
- Replace the existing images with your custom ones:
  - Rename your images as follows:
    - `onboard_01.png`
    - `onboard_02.png`
    - `onboard_03.png`
- Ensure the images are in `.png` format for better visual quality.
- Ensure the new images have the same dimensions as the originals to prevent layout distortions.

##### **Step 2: Update Onboarding Text Content**
- Navigate to the `/lib/i18n` folder.
- Open the base language file (`en.i18n.json`) and locate the `pages.onboard.onboardData` section:
  ```json
  {
    "pages": {
      "onboard": {
            "onboardData": {
                "data1": {
                    "title": "Easy to use Acnoo Restaurant",
                    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit mauris."
                },
                "data2": {
                    "title": "Effortless Order Management",
                    "description": "Streamline your restaurant's order-taking process with our intuitive POS system."
                },
                "data3": {
                    "title": "Excellent Analytics & Reporting",
                    "description": "Our analytics dashboard provides real-time sales & purchase  reports"
                }
            }
        }
    }
  }
  ```
- Modify the `title` and `description` fields for each `data` entry (`data1`, `data2`, `data3`) to reflect your desired content.

##### **Step 3: Apply Localization Changes**
- After updating the JSON files, run the following command to apply the changes to the localization classes:
  ```bash
  dart run slang
  ```
- This will update the localization class data based on the modified JSON files.

##### **Step 4: Restart the App**
- Restart the app to see the updated onboarding images and text content.

---

#### **5.3.2 Updating Themes**
- Open `_app_colors.dart`:
  - Path: `/lib/app/core/theme/_app_colors.dart`
- Modify global colors:
  ```dart
  const Color kPrimary = Color(0xFFYourHexCode);
  ```
- Save the file and hot-reload to see the changes.

> **Note**: Use hot reload to see immediate changes for most updates. However, for certain changes (e.g., app name, package name), a full restart is required.

---

#### **5.3.3 Adding or Editing Translations**
To add or edit translations, follow these steps:

##### **Step 1: Add a New Language**
- Duplicate an existing `.i18n.json` file (e.g., `en.i18n.json`) and rename it to match the new language code (e.g., `fr.i18n.json` for French).
- Translate the strings in the new file:
  ```json
  {
    "helloWorld": "Bonjour tout le monde!"
  }
  ```

##### **Step 2: Edit Existing Translations**
- Open the corresponding `.i18n.json` file (e.g., `es.i18n.json` for Spanish).
- Modify the string values:
  ```json
  {
    "helloWorld": "¡Hola a todos!"
  }
  ```

##### **Step 3: Apply Localization Changes**
- Run the following command to update the localization classes:
  ```bash
  dart run slang
  ```

##### **Step 4: Hot-Reload the App**
- Hot-reload the app to apply the changes.

---

### **5.3.4 Adding or Editing Translations**

The app uses **`slang_flutter`** for localization, which simplifies managing translations across multiple languages. Translations are stored in `.i18n.json` files located in the `/lib/i18n` folder. Each language has its own file (e.g., `en.i18n.json` for English, `es.i18n.json` for Spanish). Follow these steps to add or edit translations:

---

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Localization Structure**
- The app accesses localized strings using the `t` object, which is generated automatically by `slang_flutter`. For example:
  ```dart
  t.action.save // Accesses the "save" key under the "action" namespace.
  ```
- The structure of the `.i18n.json` files mirrors this access pattern. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "action": {
      "save": "Save",
      "cancel": "Cancel"
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### **Step 2: Adding a New Language**
1. Duplicate an existing `.i18n.json` file (e.g., `en.i18n.json`) and rename it to match the new language code. For example:
   - For French: `fr.i18n.json`
   - For German: `de.i18n.json`
2. Translate the strings in the new file. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "action": {
       "save": "Enregistrer",
       "cancel": "Annuler"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the file and run the following command to update the localization classes:
   ```bash
   dart run slang
   ```
4. Restart the app to apply the changes.

---

#### **Step 3: Editing Existing Translations**
1. Open the corresponding `.i18n.json` file for the language you want to edit (e.g., `es.i18n.json` for Spanish).
2. Modify the string values while keeping the keys unchanged. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "action": {
       "save": "Guardar", // Updated translation
       "cancel": "Cancelar"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Run the following command to update the localization classes:
   ```bash
   dart run slang
   ```
4. Hot-reload the app to see the changes.

---

#### **Step 4: Deleting a Language**
1. Remove the `.i18n.json` file for the language you want to delete (e.g., `fr.i18n.json` for French).
2. Remove references to the language from the code:
   - If any part of the app uses keys specific to the removed language (e.g., `t.action.save`), replace the reference with a static string or use the default language.
   - Example:
     ```dart
     t.action.save // Replace with:
     "Save"
     ```
3. Run the following command to update the localization classes:
   ```bash
   dart run slang
   ```
4. Restart the app to apply the changes.


> **Troubleshooting**: If translations do not appear after running `dart run slang`, ensure the `.i18n.json` file is correctly formatted and all required keys are present.
---

#### **Step 5: Common Issues**
- **Missing Translations**: If a translation is missing for a specific language, the app will fall back to the default language (English). Ensure that all required keys are present in every `.i18n.json` file.
- **Key Errors**: Always keep the keys consistent across all `.i18n.json` files. Changing a key in one file without updating others will cause runtime errors.
- **Supported Locales**: You can find the list of supported locales here:  
  [Flutter Localizations Library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations-library.html)

---

### **5.4 Troubleshooting**
- If the script fails, ensure that:
  - The `customization.yaml` file exists and is correctly formatted.
  - All required dependencies are installed (`flutter pub get`).
  - You have the necessary permissions to modify files.
- For errors related to package name changes, ensure the new package name follows the standard structure (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourappname`).
