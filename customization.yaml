# Just replace `assets/app/app_launcher/app_launcher_icon.png` this with your own icon.
# Then  run `rps customize --icon-only` or `rps customize` for full customization.
# This will only change the app launcher icon. And you'll have to replace `assets/app/app_icon.png` & `assets/app/app_splash_icon.png` for in app changes.
# Just replace those icons with your preferred icons and run `flutter clean && flutter pub get` and finally `flutter run` to see the changes.
